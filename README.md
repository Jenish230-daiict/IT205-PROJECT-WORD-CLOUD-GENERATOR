### **Word Cloud Generator using Linked List**

This project implements a **Word Cloud Generator** using a **singly linked list** as the primary data structure. The program reads a text input, processes it to extract and count unique words, and then displays a visual representation of the most frequent words in the form of a word cloud.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Text Parsing:** The input text is tokenized into individual words, removing punctuation and ignoring case sensitivity.
* **Linked List Storage:** Each unique word is stored as a node in a linked list. Each node contains:

  * The word
  * The frequency count of that word
  * A pointer to the next word node
* **Dynamic Frequency Tracking:** If a word already exists in the list, its frequency count is incremented. If itâ€™s new, a new node is appended to the list.
* **Sorting (optional):** The linked list can be sorted by frequency (descending) to prioritize the most used words in the word cloud.
* **Visualization:** The final word cloud is either printed in text format with increasing font sizes based on frequency or exported to a graphical format (if integrated with a GUI or external visualization library).

#### **Advantages of Using Linked List:**

* Dynamic memory usage: Easily handles texts of varying sizes.
* Efficient insertion of new unique words without resizing or shifting elements.
* Simple to implement and manipulate for educational purposes.

#### **Limitations:**

* Slower search compared to hash maps or balanced trees.
* Less efficient for large datasets due to linear traversal.

#### **Applications:**

* Educational tools for understanding data structures.
* Basic text analysis tools.
* Backend for simple UI-based word cloud apps.
